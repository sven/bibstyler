Introduction
------------

Bibstyler is a simple script to generate all needed Biblatex styles (list at
the bottom) with the same layout.

Doesn't make sense? Should not every style has its own layout?

In this case: no. This tool was written because some people from the Chemnitz
University of Technology asked for a unique style of entries no matter what
type of article, book, reporter etc. it is.
